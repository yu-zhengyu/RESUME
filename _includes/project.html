			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="">Quantification of esophagus imaging with Optical Coherence Tomography</a></strong>
			<br/>This is my graduate research thesis, used denosing method and edge detection algorithm to detected the contour of esophagus and computing the area of esophagus base on the contour.
			<br/>• Implemented the denosing method and edge detection algorithm.
			<br/>• Applied the mathematical morphology edge detection and modify it as multi-scale mathematical morphology edge detected algorithm.
			<br/>• Successfully detected the contour of esophagus and computing the area of esophagus base on the contour.

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/yu-zhengyu/Web-Crawler-python">Web Crawler using python</a></strong>
			<br/>This is a course project for Coding Boot Camp. We developed a topic-specific web crawler that will crawl the web looking for information on a specific topic. 
			<br/>•	Developed a web Crawler using BeautifulSoup tool. Recursively crawled links on a web page using BFS and DFS mode and Stored data in a database. 
			<br/>•	Used command line to control and user can terminate it any time. 
			<br/>•	Developed the project using Agile Methodology.

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/yu-zhengyu/ShadowMaster">Game: Shadow Master</a></strong>
			<br/>This project is a game project which prepare for Imagine Cup, a game which holded by Microsoft, This project can use webcam simulate the shadow of humnan's hand.
			<br/>•	Developed a PC game Using C#, XNA frame work.
			<br/>•	Implemented human’s hand detector using OpenCV and Skin-color detect algorithm.
			<br/>•	The game could detect human’s hand without any other tools, only used webcam on computer, shown the shape of player’s hand, computed the score.
